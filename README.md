A continuation/update of Fantasy Slave Trainer by Onerglossi
This project is focused on refining/updating the base game.

Project goals:
- UI and navigation improvements : QoL/gameplay focused
- Recovery/implementation of unused, bugged, or planned/unimplemented items and assets.
- Slight expansion of game world based on the original game framework.
- Simplification/refinement of sex/gender dynamics and training slaves.
- Graphics for UI and atmosphere (slave & character art eventually).
- Addition of some features/concepts from other slave trainer style games.

* End goal is to "crystalize" a complete version of this game. 
  (With enough interest/support I might start work on a v2)
